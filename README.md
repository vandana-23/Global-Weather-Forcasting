Techniques:-
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
- Anomaly Detection (Z-score)
- Climate & Spatial Analysis
  
output:
- Visualized global temperature/precipitation trends.
- Built forecasting model per city.
- Identified air quality and climate anomalies.
  
some Extra thing calculated like :-
- PM2.5 and PM10 show positive correlation with temperature and humidity in some cases.
- CO, NO₂, and SO₂ are generally more weakly correlated but can be affected by wind and rain.
- Pairplots show linear trends between PM2.5 and temperature in certain cities.
- Regional comparison helps identify more polluted locations.
